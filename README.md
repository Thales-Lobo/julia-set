# Julia Set Fractal Renderer

This project computes and renders the Julia Set fractal using both sequential and parallel algorithms. The resulting images are saved in BMP format. The project also includes performance analysis tools to evaluate the execution times and speedup between the sequential and parallel implementations.

## Building the Project
The project uses a Makefile for building both the sequential and parallel implementations. To compile the program, simply run the following command in the respective directory:

For Sequential/Parallel Implementation:
```bash
make
```

After building, the compiled executable will be located in the build/ directory for each implementation.

## Running the Program
- Sequential Program:
To run the sequential program, use the following command:

```bash
.make run <n>
```
Where <n> is the number of iterations for the Julia Set computation.

- Parallel Program:
To run the parallel program, use:

```bash
./run <np> <n>
```
Where <np> is the number of processes, and <n> is the number of iterations.

- Performance Analysis:
To generate performance graphs and analyze the results, navigate to the analysis/ directory and run the following command:

```bash
./run
```
This will execute the plot generation process using the data files available in the analysis/src/ folder, and produce graphs such as execution_time_vs_processes_for_resolution_4000.png, execution_time_vs_resolution_filtered.png, and speedup_vs_processes.png.

## Execution Reports
The project generates execution reports for both the sequential and parallel implementations. The reports are stored in CSV format in the report/ folder for each implementation:

- sequential_execution_report.csv (Sequential)
- parallel_execution_report.csv (Parallel)
- These reports contain detailed information about the execution times and the performance of the program under various configurations.
