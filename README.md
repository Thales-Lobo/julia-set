# Julia Set Fractal Renderer (Sequential)

This project calculates and renders a Julia Set fractal using a sequential algorithm. The resulting image is saved in BMP format.

## Directory Descriptions
- src/: Contains all the .c source files for the project.
- include/: Stores the .h header files, which define the interfaces for the source files.
- build/: Used for compiled object files and the final executable.
- images/: Holds the BMP images generated by the program.
- Makefile: Automates the build process and manages dependencies.

## Building the Project
To compile the program, simply use make. The output executable and object files will be stored in the build/ directory.
